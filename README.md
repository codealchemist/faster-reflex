# faster-reflex ‚ö°Ô∏è

Can you beat your friends with a faster reflex? ‚ö°Ô∏è

## Objective

You'll be presented with a target color.

After hitting _"Start"_ other colors will be shown at a given interval.

The objective is to click / tap as fast as possible on the box when you see the target color!

If you do it before the color changes you win, if not you lose.

When you got it in time you'll see how fast your reflex was in milliseconds.

Give it a try and challenge your friends!

Who has the fastest reflexes?

Anyone there faster than an elephant? üòπ

## Training

You can choose between several training modes.

Each one presents a different difficulty level by changing colors faster!

Starting at 1s should work for most people.

The 500ms level is pretty challenging!

And 250ms is almost imposible!

But you might be lucky üòÇ

## Development

`npm run dev`


Enjoy!
